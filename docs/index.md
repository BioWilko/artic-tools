## Introduction

The ARTIC pipeline (available [here](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics)) is a bioinformatics pipeline for working with virus sequencing data produced using nanopore. We've been working on `artic-tools` as a complimentary set of utilities for helping with amplicon sequencing workflows and plan to incorporate them into the ARTIC pipeline.
